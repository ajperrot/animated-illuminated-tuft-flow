<h1>Program 1 Extension:
Time Animated, Illuminated Tuft Vector Field</h1>
This visualization, as an extension of prog1,
seeks to display the same type of data,
wind speed and direction over a set area in the Houston/Galveston gulf coast,
in a new way, a grid of tufts bent and rotated in accordance with the data
and colored using an approximation of phong shading streamlined by texture mapping.
These tufts will be animated via time, showing a different value across a 24-hour
time period each frame.

Please clink the link to the left to run the project for yourself in-browser,
and see it firsthand.

Below is the animation in both color and grayscale
(slowed down for gif representation)

And this is the animation on the level of a single tuft:
